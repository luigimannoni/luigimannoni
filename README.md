# Ciao üëã, I'm [Luigi](https://luigimannoni.com)

A creative full stack developer, with more than 10 years of tracked professional experience in web development, although I've been coding for fun for almost 20 years now.

## What I do

I'm mostly javascript focused but an all-rounder, I do work with React, Nodejs, Threejs and WebGL. 
Currently a contractor for [@deimosindustries](https://twitter.com/dmosindustries), based in London, United Kingdom.

Recently I've been working with a range of clients, most prominently the fab world-saving guys at [üåç Friends of the Earth England](https://friendsoftheearth.uk).
